# C-Start

This repository contains various exercises and projects designed to help you learn the C programming language and practice basic algorithms. Each folder is dedicated to a different topic or project.

## Folders and Contents

- **C00 - C06**: Basic C exercises. Each folder contains sub-exercises (`ex00`, `ex01`, ...) related to the topic.
  - **C00**: Basic functions (printing, character operations, loops).
  - **C01**: Pointers, arrays, and functions.
  - **C02**: String operations and functions on character arrays.
  - **C03**: String comparison and concatenation functions.
  - **C04**: Standard input/output operations and numeric functions.
  - **C05**: Recursive and iterative mathematical functions (factorial, power, fibonacci, prime numbers).
  - **C06**: Working with command-line arguments.

- **Rush00**: Mini project focused on algorithms and problem solving in C.
- **Shell00**: Basic shell command and script exercises.
